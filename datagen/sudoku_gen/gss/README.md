The Generic Sudoku Solver (gss) can solve and generate many types of 
sudokus (such as jigsaw sudokus, NRC sudokus parquet sudokus, etc.).
The gss program allows the user to define the sudoklu structure so you 
can define your own custom sudoku types.

the examples directory and its subdirectories. The examples are
